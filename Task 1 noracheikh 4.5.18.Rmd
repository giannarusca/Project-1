Step 1 Upload and Merge Datasets
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#1. Upload data files to desktop
#2. Import datasets into R and label
subject_test <- read.table("~/Desktop/subject_test.txt")
subject_train <- read.table("~/Desktop/subject_train.txt")
X_test <- read.table("~/Desktop/X_test.txt")
X_train <- read.table("~/Desktop/X_train.txt")
y_test <- read.table("~/Desktop/y_test.txt")
y_train <- read.table("~/Desktop/y_train.txt")
#3 Rename variables in subject and y data frames, so V1 from X data frames is not confused with the V1 from the subject and y data frames
colnames(subject_train)[colnames(subject_train)=="V1"] <- "subject"
colnames(subject_test)[colnames(subject_test)=="V1"] <- "subject"
colnames(y_test)[colnames(y_test)=="V1"] <- "y"
colnames(y_train)[colnames(y_train)=="V1"] <- "y"
#4 Combine the Columns. Combine the test data frames and the train data frames seperately and label
test <- cbind( subject_test, y_test, X_test)
train <- cbind(subject_train, y_train, X_train)
#5 Combine the Rows. Combine the dataframes, test and train and label 'Task1.1'
Task1.1 <- rbind(test, train)
#6 Save Task1.1 data frame as a csv file
write.csv(Task1.1, "Task1.1")
```
